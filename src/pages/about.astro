      Charted is an open-source project to build an interactive, navigable map of human knowledge — starting with mathematics and expanding to all the sciences.

      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        Most educational resources present knowledge as a linear path: chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3. But real knowledge isn't linear. It's a web. Number theory connects to cryptography. Topology connects to data analysis. Category theory bridges algebra and logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Charted makes this web visible. Each topic is a node. Each connection is an edge. You can zoom in to learn about a specific field, or zoom out to see how the sciences fit together.
      </p>

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>
        Every topic page is a simple MDX file in a Git repository. Anyone can contribute by opening a pull request. The interactive map is generated from the topic metadata — titles, descriptions, parent fields, and prerequisite links.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site is built with Astro, React, and D3.js. It's fully static, fast, and open source.
      </p>
