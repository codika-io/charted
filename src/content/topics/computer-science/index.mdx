Computer Science is the systematic study of computation and information. Its seven branches span the full arc of the discipline: Theoretical Foundations lays the mathematical groundwork with algorithms, data structures, complexity theory, and information theory; Programming & Languages covers how we express computation through languages, compilers, software engineering, and formal verification; Systems addresses the hardware and software infrastructure — architecture, operating systems, networks, distributed computing, security, and parallelism; Data & Information treats the storage, retrieval, and analysis of data; AI & Machine Learning explores intelligent systems from classical search and planning through modern deep learning, NLP, and robotics; Graphics & Vision covers visual computing and human-computer interaction; and Applied & Interdisciplinary brings computer science to bear on cryptography, quantum computing, and bioinformatics. The branches are ordered so that each one builds on the ideas before it.
