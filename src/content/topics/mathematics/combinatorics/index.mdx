Combinatorics answers a deceptively simple question: how many? How many ways can you seat guests at a table, color a map, or route a network? The answers often involve surprising structures — generating functions, Ramsey theory, matroids — that connect to algebra, geometry, and computer science.

It is also the mathematical backbone of algorithm design: most questions about computational complexity are, at root, combinatorial.
