Number theory starts with the most concrete objects in mathematics — 1, 2, 3, ... — yet contains some of its deepest unsolved problems. The Riemann Hypothesis, Goldbach's conjecture, and the twin prime conjecture are all fundamentally questions about integers.

It is also unexpectedly practical: modern cryptography rests almost entirely on number-theoretic results about primes and modular arithmetic.
