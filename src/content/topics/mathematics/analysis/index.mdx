Analysis is calculus made honest. Newton and Leibniz invented calculus in the 17th century using intuitive notions of "infinitely small quantities." It took two more centuries — through Cauchy, Weierstrass, and Riemann — to replace intuition with rigorous epsilon-delta definitions.

The payoff is enormous: analysis underpins physics, engineering, probability, and much of modern mathematics, from differential equations to functional analysis.
