Topology asks: what properties of a shape remain when you're allowed to stretch and bend it freely, but never tear or glue? A coffee cup and a donut are topologically identical (both have one hole), but a sphere is fundamentally different.

This seemingly playful question turns out to be profoundly powerful, with applications in data analysis (topological data analysis), physics (knot theory, string theory), and the classification of manifolds.
