Applied mathematics takes the structures and theorems of pure mathematics and puts them to work on real-world problems. Numerical analysis makes computation reliable. Optimization finds the best solution among many. Information theory quantifies communication. Game theory models strategic interaction. Cryptography secures it. And mathematical physics reveals the deep mathematical structure of the physical universe.

These fields are not merely "applications" — they generate profound mathematics of their own, from the simplex method to Shannon entropy to gauge theory.
