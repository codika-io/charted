Probability gives randomness a precise mathematical language, built on measure theory (a branch of analysis) and combinatorics. Statistics goes the other direction: given data generated by some unknown process, what can we infer about that process?

Together they are the most widely applied branch of mathematics — essential in science, medicine, finance, machine learning, and everyday decision-making.
