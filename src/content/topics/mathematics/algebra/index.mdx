Algebra begins where arithmetic ends. For millennia, mathematics was about particular calculations — solving this quadratic, finding that unknown, computing a specific product. Then, slowly, a more powerful question emerged: what are the underlying *rules* that make all calculations work? The shift from computing with numbers to reasoning about the structures that govern computation is one of the deepest conceptual moves in the history of mathematics, and it gave rise to modern algebra.

The story accelerates dramatically in the nineteenth century. Évariste Galois, working in feverish bursts before his death at twenty, showed that the solvability of polynomial equations is governed by the symmetry of their roots — a symmetry captured by what we now call a group. Niels Henrik Abel had independently reached related territory, proving that the general quintic cannot be solved by radicals. Their work did not merely answer old questions about equations; it revealed that the real object of study was the *symmetry group* lurking behind each equation. This was a revolution. Symmetry, previously a geometric intuition, became an algebraic object that could be calculated with, classified, and applied everywhere from crystallography to particle physics.

The abstract perspective deepened through the twentieth century. Emmy Noether — arguably the most transformative algebraist of the modern era — stripped algebra down to its axiomatic bones. Her work on rings, ideals, and modules showed that vast swaths of mathematics could be understood through a handful of structural properties, independent of the specific objects involved. David Hilbert, her colleague at Göttingen, pursued the algebraic foundations of geometry with the same axiomatic clarity. Together they established that abstraction was not a retreat from reality but a lens that made deeper patterns visible.

The branch you are about to explore spans six interconnected sub-topics, each illuminating a different facet of this structural mathematics. Abstract Algebra is the natural entry point: it develops the core objects — groups, rings, fields — and builds toward Galois theory, the crown jewel that binds symmetry to solvability. Groups describe symmetry in its purest form; rings generalize the arithmetic of integers; fields are the settings where division is always possible and where Galois's ideas live most naturally. Homological algebra, growing out of ring and module theory, provides the machinery to measure how structures fail to be simple, turning defects into computable invariants.

Linear Algebra sits alongside Abstract Algebra as an essential companion. Vector spaces and linear maps are the workhorses of applied mathematics, data science, and quantum mechanics alike, but they are also deeply algebraic objects. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the spectral theorem, Jordan normal form, tensor products — all of these are algebraic facts about linear structure, and mastering them opens the door to nearly every other branch of mathematics and physics. Arthur Cayley's matrix algebra, developed in the 1850s, was an early sign of things to come: even the act of composing transformations has algebraic structure.

Commutative Algebra sharpens the study of rings by focusing on those where multiplication is commutative — the natural algebraic setting for geometry. The prime spectrum of a ring is a shadow of classical algebraic curves and surfaces, and Noether's ascending chain condition for ideals (the Noetherian property) is the key that makes the whole theory tractable. Primary decomposition generalizes unique factorization, dimension theory measures the "size" of rings in a geometric sense, and localization allows one to zoom in on a single prime. This sub-topic is the algebraic foundation on which algebraic geometry is built.

Category Theory steps back even further and asks: what do all these algebraic structures have in common? Saunders Mac Lane and Samuel Eilenberg invented categories in 1945 to formalize the notion of "natural" constructions in algebra and topology. A category is just a collection of objects and arrows between them satisfying simple composition laws, but this minimal framework captures an astonishing range of mathematics. Functors translate between categories; natural transformations compare functors; adjoint pairs of functors encode universal properties that recur across mathematics. Topos theory extends these ideas into logic and set theory, and higher category theory — still very much a frontier — seeks to do the same for homotopy. If Abstract Algebra is the grammar of structure, Category Theory is the grammar of grammars.

Representation Theory asks a different but equally profound question: given an abstract group or algebra, what does it *look like* when it acts on a concrete vector space? A representation turns abstract symmetry into matrices, making it computable. The character theory of finite groups — developed by Frobenius, Burnside, and Schur — reveals that much of the structure of a group is encoded in a finite table of numbers, its character table. This approach reaches its apex in the representations of Lie groups, where harmonic analysis, geometry, and algebra converge.

Lie Theory, finally, studies the algebra of continuous symmetry. Sophus Lie introduced Lie groups in the 1870s to do for differential equations what Galois had done for polynomial ones: classify their symmetries and use those symmetries to solve them. The infinitesimal version of a Lie group is its Lie algebra, and the classification of semisimple Lie algebras — achieved through the root systems and Dynkin diagrams developed by Killing, Cartan, and Dynkin — is one of the great achievements of twentieth-century mathematics. The resulting list of families and exceptional cases (G2, F4, E6, E7, E8) has deep connections to geometry, physics, and combinatorics that are still being unraveled.

These six sub-topics do not sit in a line — they form a web. Abstract Algebra supplies the objects that Category Theory organizes, that Commutative Algebra specializes, that Representation Theory makes concrete, and that Lie Theory extends to the continuous world. Linear Algebra runs through all of them as the indispensable language of explicit calculation. Read in the order suggested here — Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Commutative Algebra, Category Theory, Representation Theory, Lie Theory — or follow the prerequisites that interest you most. The structures you encounter will recur throughout mathematics, quietly organizing everything they touch.
