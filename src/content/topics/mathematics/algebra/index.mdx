Algebra begins where arithmetic ends. Instead of computing with specific numbers, it asks: what are the *rules* that make computation work? This question leads to groups (symmetry), rings (generalized arithmetic), and fields (where division always works).

These abstract structures turn out to be everywhere — in physics (symmetry groups), cryptography (finite fields), and across mathematics itself.
