Lie theory is the mathematical study of continuous symmetry — the symmetry of smooth objects under continuous transformations. Born in the 1870s from **Sophus Lie**'s audacious attempt to apply Galois theory to differential equations, it has grown into one of the deepest and most far-reaching structures in all of mathematics, touching differential geometry, number theory, quantum physics, and the very foundations of modern representation theory. The central insight is deceptively simple: a smooth group can be studied locally, near the identity element, through its linear approximation — a Lie algebra — and this linearization translates hard nonlinear problems into linear algebra.

## Lie Groups and Their Properties

A **Lie group** is simultaneously a smooth manifold and a group, with the requirement that the group operations — multiplication and inversion — are smooth maps. This blending of algebra and geometry is what makes the theory so powerful. The smoothness condition is not merely a technical nicety; it is what allows calculus to enter group theory, enabling the definition of tangent vectors, differential forms, and one-parameter subgroups.

The canonical examples are the **matrix Lie groups** — closed subgroups of $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$ or $GL(n, \mathbb{C})$, the general linear group of invertible $n \times n$ matrices. The **special linear group** $SL(n, \mathbb{F}) = \{A \in GL(n, \mathbb{F}) : \det(A) = 1\}$ is an $(n^2 - 1)$-dimensional Lie group. The **orthogonal group** $O(n) = \{A \in GL(n, \mathbb{R}) : A^T A = I\}$ and its connected component $SO(n)$ encode the rotational symmetries of Euclidean space. The **unitary group** $U(n) = \{A \in GL(n, \mathbb{C}) : A^\dagger A = I\}$ and the **special unitary group** $SU(n)$ are their complex counterparts. The **symplectic group** $Sp(2n, \mathbb{F})$ preserves a non-degenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form and plays a central role in Hamiltonian mechanics. These classical groups, together with the five exceptional Lie groups, form the complete landscape of simple Lie groups.

A fundamental result is the **closed subgroup theorem** (also called the Cartan theorem after **Élie Cartan**, who proved it in 1930): any closed subgroup of a Lie group is itself a Lie group. This theorem means one can specify groups by algebraic conditions — such as the determinant being 1, or a matrix being orthogonal — and be guaranteed a smooth manifold structure for free.

Topological properties of Lie groups are essential context. A Lie group may be **compact** (like $SO(n)$, $SU(n)$, and $Sp(n)$) or **non-compact** (like $SL(n, \mathbb{R})$ and $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$). Compact Lie groups are analytically better-behaved: every representation is completely reducible, and the group carries a unique probability measure invariant under left translation (the **Haar measure**). Every connected Lie group has a **universal covering group**, which is a simply-connected Lie group with the same local structure. The classical example is $SU(2)$ covering $SO(3)$ with a degree-two covering map — a fact that explains the mysterious half-integer spin of electrons in quantum mechanics.

## Lie Algebras and Structure Theory

The **Lie algebra** $\mathfrak{g}$ of a Lie group $G$ is the tangent space at the identity element, equipped with an additional operation called the **Lie bracket**. Concretely, for a matrix group, $\mathfrak{g}$ consists of matrices $X$ such that $e^{tX} \in G$ for all real $t$, and the bracket is simply the matrix commutator $[X, Y] = XY - YX$. More abstractly, a Lie algebra is a vector space equipped with a bracket $[\cdot, \cdot]: \mathfrak{g} \times \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g}$ satisfying three axioms: bilinearity, antisymmetry $[X, Y] = -[Y, X]$, and the **Jacobi identity**

$$[X, [Y, Z]] + [Y, [Z, X]] + [Z, [X, Y]] = 0.$$

The Jacobi identity is the infinitesimal echo of associativity in the group, and it is precisely what distinguishes a Lie algebra from a mere anti-commutative algebra.

The passage from groups to algebras is made concrete by the **exponential map** $\exp: \mathfrak{g} \to G$, defined by the matrix exponential $\exp(X) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty X^k / k!$ for matrix groups, and more generally by following the flow of the left-invariant vector field generated by $X$ for unit time. Near the identity, the exponential map is a diffeomorphism, meaning $\mathfrak{g}$ captures the full local structure of $G$. The relationship between two group elements near the identity is governed by the **Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula**:

$$\log(\exp(X)\exp(Y)) = X + Y + \tfrac{1}{2}[X,Y] + \tfrac{1}{12}([X,[X,Y]] + [Y,[Y,X]]) + \cdots,$$

an infinite series whose terms involve only nested Lie brackets. This formula shows that the group multiplication, locally, is entirely determined by the Lie algebra structure.

The intrinsic structure of a Lie algebra is studied through its **derived series** and **lower central series**. A Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is **solvable** if its derived series $\mathfrak{g} \supset [\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}] \supset [[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}],[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]] \supset \cdots$ terminates at zero; it is **nilpotent** if its lower central series terminates at zero. **Engel's theorem** (1890) characterizes nilpotent algebras: $\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent if and only if every element acts nilpotently (i.e., as a nilpotent endomorphism) under the adjoint representation $\mathrm{ad}_X(Y) = [X, Y]$.

The **radical** of $\mathfrak{g}$, denoted $\mathrm{rad}(\mathfrak{g})$, is the largest solvable ideal. A Lie algebra is **semisimple** if its radical is zero. The **Levi decomposition** theorem (proved by **Eugenio Levi** in 1905 and corrected by Lie) states that any finite-dimensional Lie algebra splits as $\mathfrak{g} = \mathrm{rad}(\mathfrak{g}) \rtimes \mathfrak{s}$, a semidirect product of the radical with a semisimple complement $\mathfrak{s}$. This reduces the classification problem to understanding solvable algebras and semisimple algebras separately — and it is the semisimple case that yields one of the most beautiful classification theorems in mathematics.

## Root Systems and Cartan Classification

The classification of simple Lie algebras over $\mathbb{C}$ is one of the crowning achievements of 19th and early 20th century mathematics, completed by Killing and Cartan between 1888 and 1894. The key tool is the combinatorial data encoded in a **root system**.

Given a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, a **Cartan subalgebra** $\mathfrak{h}$ is a maximal abelian subalgebra consisting entirely of semisimple (diagonalizable) elements. All Cartan subalgebras of a semisimple algebra are conjugate under inner automorphisms, so the dimension of $\mathfrak{h}$, called the **rank** of $\mathfrak{g}$, is well-defined. The Cartan subalgebra acts on $\mathfrak{g}$ by the adjoint representation, and since elements of $\mathfrak{h}$ are simultaneously diagonalizable, $\mathfrak{g}$ decomposes into a direct sum of simultaneous eigenspaces:

$$\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{h} \oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha \in \Phi} \mathfrak{g}_\alpha,$$

where $\Phi \subset \mathfrak{h}^*$ is the finite set of **roots** — the nonzero linear functionals $\alpha$ for which $\mathfrak{g}_\alpha = \{X \in \mathfrak{g} : [H, X] = \alpha(H) X \text{ for all } H \in \mathfrak{h}\}$ is nonzero. Each root space $\mathfrak{g}_\alpha$ turns out to be one-dimensional, and the algebra is spanned by these root spaces together with $\mathfrak{h}$.

An abstract **root system** is a finite subset $\Phi$ of a Euclidean space $V$ satisfying four axioms: the roots span $V$; if $\alpha \in \Phi$, then $-\alpha \in \Phi$ and the only scalar multiples of $\alpha$ in $\Phi$ are $\pm \alpha$; every root $\alpha$ defines a reflection $s_\alpha$ that preserves $\Phi$; and for all $\alpha, \beta \in \Phi$, the **Cartan integer** $\langle \beta, \alpha \rangle = 2(\beta, \alpha)/(\alpha, \alpha)$ is an integer. This last condition, the **crystallographic restriction**, severely constrains the possible angles between roots: the angle between two roots must be a multiple of $30°$.

A set of **simple roots** $\Delta \subset \Phi$ is a basis for $V$ such that every root is either a non-negative or a non-positive integer linear combination of elements of $\Delta$. The Cartan integers between simple roots are encoded in the **Cartan matrix** $A$, with entries $A_{ij} = \langle \alpha_i, \alpha_j \rangle$, and this matrix is displayed visually as a **Dynkin diagram**: one node per simple root, with $A_{ij} A_{ji}$ edges between nodes $i$ and $j$ (0, 1, 2, or 3), and an arrow pointing toward the shorter root when roots have different lengths.

The classification of irreducible root systems — equivalently, of complex simple Lie algebras — is then a finite combinatorial problem. The complete list consists of four infinite families and five exceptional cases:

- $A_n$ ($n \geq 1$): corresponds to $\mathfrak{sl}(n+1)$, with Dynkin diagram a straight chain of $n$ nodes.
- $B_n$ ($n \geq 2$): corresponds to $\mathfrak{so}(2n+1)$, with a chain ending in a double edge with arrow.
- $C_n$ ($n \geq 3$): corresponds to $\mathfrak{sp}(2n)$, with a chain ending in a double edge with arrow in the other direction.
- $D_n$ ($n \geq 4$): corresponds to $\mathfrak{so}(2n)$, with a chain ending in a fork.
- Exceptionals: $G_2$, $F_4$, $E_6$, $E_7$, $E_8$, discovered by **Wilhelm Killing** in 1888 and constructed explicitly by Cartan.

The **Weyl group** $W$ of a root system is the group generated by the reflections $s_\alpha$ for all $\alpha \in \Phi$. It is a finite group acting faithfully on the root system, and it encodes the symmetry of the Dynkin diagram. For $A_n$, the Weyl group is the symmetric group $S_{n+1}$; for $B_n$ and $C_n$, it is the hyperoctahedral group.

## Representation Theory of Lie Groups and Algebras

The theory of representations — how Lie groups and algebras act as linear transformations on vector spaces — is where the abstract theory meets its most spectacular applications.

A **representation** of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ on a vector space $V$ is a Lie algebra homomorphism $\rho: \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{gl}(V)$, where $\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ denotes the space of all linear endomorphisms of $V$ with the commutator bracket. The fundamental organizing principle for finite-dimensional representations of semisimple algebras is the **theory of highest weights**, developed by **Élie Cartan** in the early 1900s. For a fixed Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ and a choice of positive roots, every element of $\mathfrak{h}$ acts diagonally on any finite-dimensional representation $V$, decomposing it into **weight spaces**:

$$V = \bigoplus_{\mu \in \mathfrak{h}^*} V_\mu, \quad V_\mu = \{v \in V : H \cdot v = \mu(H) v \text{ for all } H \in \mathfrak{h}\}.$$

The **dominant integral weights** $\lambda$ satisfying $\langle \lambda, \alpha^\vee \rangle \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ for all positive coroots $\alpha^\vee$ parametrize the irreducible representations. The **highest weight theorem** states that every irreducible finite-dimensional representation $L(\lambda)$ is uniquely determined by its highest weight $\lambda$, and conversely, every dominant integral weight arises as the highest weight of exactly one irreducible. The highest weight vector $v_\lambda \in L(\lambda)$ is annihilated by all positive root operators and generates the entire representation by the action of negative root operators.

The **Weyl character formula**, proved by **Hermann Weyl** in 1925, gives the character — the function $\chi_\lambda(H) = \mathrm{tr}_{L(\lambda)}(e^H)$ — of an irreducible representation explicitly:

$$\chi_\lambda = \frac{\sum_{w \in W} (-1)^{\ell(w)} e^{w(\lambda + \rho) - \rho}}{\prod_{\alpha > 0}(1 - e^{-\alpha})},$$

where $\rho = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\alpha > 0} \alpha$ is the **Weyl vector** (the half-sum of positive roots) and $\ell(w)$ is the length of the Weyl group element $w$. From this formula, the **Weyl dimension formula** yields the dimension of $L(\lambda)$ as a product over positive roots:

$$\dim L(\lambda) = \prod_{\alpha > 0} \frac{\langle \lambda + \rho, \alpha \rangle}{\langle \rho, \alpha \rangle}.$$

For compact Lie groups, the **Peter-Weyl theorem** (proved by **Fritz Peter** and Hermann Weyl in 1927) plays an analogous role in infinite-dimensional harmonic analysis: the matrix coefficients of irreducible unitary representations form an orthonormal basis for $L^2(G)$ with respect to the Haar measure. This theorem is the non-abelian generalization of Fourier analysis, reducing harmonic analysis on a compact group to the algebraic classification of its irreducible representations.

## Classical Lie Groups and Algebras

The classical Lie groups — $SL(n)$, $SO(n)$, $SU(n)$, and $Sp(2n)$ — deserve individual study both as the prototypical examples of the theory and for their direct role in geometry and physics.

The **special linear group** $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ is the simplest non-abelian semisimple Lie group and the testing ground for the entire theory. Its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{C})$ is spanned by three elements

$$e = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad h = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix},$$

satisfying $[h, e] = 2e$, $[h, f] = -2f$, $[e, f] = h$. The irreducible representations are labeled by non-negative integers $n$: the unique $(n+1)$-dimensional representation $V_n$ has a basis of weight vectors with weights $n, n-2, \ldots, -n$. The half-integer-weight representations of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ lift to representations of the universal cover $\widetilde{SL}(2, \mathbb{R}) \cong SU(2)$ but not of $SO(3)$ itself — this is the algebraic explanation for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in physics.

The orthogonal and spin groups are linked by a double covering. For $n \geq 3$, the **spin group** $\mathrm{Spin}(n)$ is the universal double cover of $SO(n)$: there is a surjective homomorphism $\mathrm{Spin}(n) \to SO(n)$ with kernel $\{+1, -1\} \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. The **spinor representation** of $\mathrm{Spin}(n)$ does not descend to a representation of $SO(n)$ — its weights are half-integers — and this is responsible for the existence of fermionic fields in physics. In low dimensions there are exceptional isomorphisms: $\mathrm{Spin}(3) \cong SU(2)$, $\mathrm{Spin}(4) \cong SU(2) \times SU(2)$, $\mathrm{Spin}(5) \cong Sp(4)$, and $\mathrm{Spin}(6) \cong SU(4)$, reflecting the coincidences $B_1 \cong C_1$, $D_2 \cong A_1 \times A_1$, $B_2 \cong C_2$, and $D_3 \cong A_3$ in the Dynkin diagram classification.

The unitary groups play a central role in quantum mechanics. The group $SU(2)$ is diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere $S^3$ and acts as the group of unit quaternions. The irreducible representations of $SU(n)$ are parametrized by **Young diagrams** — combinatorial objects encoding the partitions of non-negative integers — and their characters are given by the **Schur polynomials**, connecting representation theory to algebraic combinatorics. The Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of tensor products into irreducibles, and the branching rules for restricting representations to subgroups, are of direct computational importance in quantum chemistry and particle physics.

## Symmetric Spaces and Geometry

The study of symmetric spaces, initiated by **Élie Cartan** in his series of papers from 1926 to 1935, reveals how Lie theory governs the global geometry of the most important Riemannian manifolds.

A **Riemannian symmetric space** is a Riemannian manifold $M$ such that at every point $p \in M$ there exists an isometry $s_p: M \to M$ that fixes $p$ and reverses all geodesics through $p$ — that is, $ds_p|_p = -\mathrm{Id}$. The key consequence is that such a space is homogeneous: its isometry group $G$ acts transitively, so $M \cong G/K$ for $K$ the stabilizer of any fixed point. The involution $\theta: G \to G$ defined by $\theta(g) = s_p \circ g \circ s_p$ is a Lie group automorphism with $\theta^2 = \mathrm{Id}$, and it induces a decomposition of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{k} \oplus \mathfrak{p}$, where $\mathfrak{k}$ is the $+1$-eigenspace (the Lie algebra of $K$) and $\mathfrak{p}$ is the $-1$-eigenspace (the tangent space at the base point). The conditions $[\mathfrak{k}, \mathfrak{k}] \subset \mathfrak{k}$, $[\mathfrak{k}, \mathfrak{p}] \subset \mathfrak{p}$, and $[\mathfrak{p}, \mathfrak{p}] \subset \mathfrak{k}$ encode the entire geometric structure of the symmetric space in purely algebraic terms — this is the **Cartan decomposition**.

Symmetric spaces come in two flavors. A **compact type** symmetric space (such as the sphere $S^n \cong SO(n+1)/SO(n)$, the Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(k,n) \cong O(n)/(O(k) \times O(n-k))$, and the complex projective space $\mathbb{CP}^n \cong SU(n+1)/U(n)$) has non-negative sectional curvature. Its **non-compact dual** (such as real hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n \cong SO(n,1)/SO(n)$, the Siegel upper half-space, and the space of positive definite matrices) has non-positive sectional curvature. The duality between compact and non-compact symmetric spaces — swapping $\mathfrak{p} \mapsto i\mathfrak{p}$ in the Cartan decomposition — is a fundamental symmetry of the theory, analogous to the relationship between the sphere and hyperbolic space.

Cartan's complete classification of symmetric spaces yielded a finite list: the classical spaces associated with the four families of classical groups, plus twelve exceptional spaces associated with the exceptional Lie groups, including the octonion projective plane $\mathbb{OP}^2 \cong F_4/\mathrm{Spin}(9)$. The geometry of geodesics on symmetric spaces is governed entirely by the root system: geodesics through the base point are parametrized by elements of $\mathfrak{p}$, and the root system of the symmetric space (which may differ from the root system of $G$) controls the flat submanifolds (the **flats** or **maximal tori**) and the curvature tensor explicitly.

## Algebraic Groups

The theory of **algebraic groups** transports Lie theory into algebraic geometry, replacing smooth manifolds by algebraic varieties and allowing the base field to be arbitrary — in particular, finite fields or the $p$-adic numbers.

An **algebraic group** $G$ over a field $k$ is an algebraic variety over $k$ equipped with morphisms $\mu: G \times G \to G$ (multiplication) and $\iota: G \to G$ (inversion) that are regular maps of varieties and satisfy the group axioms. The classical matrix groups — $GL_n$, $SL_n$, $SO_n$, $Sp_{2n}$ — are all algebraic groups, defined by polynomial equations on the space of matrices.

The structure theory of reductive algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields, developed primarily by **Claude Chevalley** in the 1950s and **Armand Borel** and **Jacques Tits** in the 1960s, mirrors the Lie algebra classification remarkably faithfully. The central notion is a **Borel subgroup** $B \subset G$ — a maximal solvable connected algebraic subgroup. The quotient variety $G/B$ is a projective variety called the **flag variety** (since for $G = GL_n$, it parametrizes complete flags $0 = V_0 \subset V_1 \subset \cdots \subset V_n = k^n$). The **Bruhat decomposition** $G = \bigsqcup_{w \in W} BwB$ decomposes $G$ into double cosets indexed by the Weyl group, and the corresponding decomposition of the flag variety $G/B = \bigsqcup_{w \in W} Bw \cdot [B]$ into **Schubert cells** provides a cell decomposition of this projective variety.

Over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$, algebraic groups give rise to finite groups of Lie type — the groups $GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$, $SL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$, $SO_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$, and so on — which account for the vast majority of finite simple groups in the **classification of finite simple groups**. Chevalley's construction of these groups over arbitrary fields unified the theory and produced several new families (the **Chevalley groups** and **Steinberg variations**). The representation theory of algebraic groups — particularly in characteristic $p > 0$, where complete reducibility can fail — remains an active area of research, with Lusztig's conjecture on modular representations only partially resolved.

The algebraic group perspective also leads naturally to the **Langlands program**, the vast web of conjectures (and theorems) connecting number theory, automorphic forms, and representation theory of reductive groups over local and global fields — arguably the deepest open problem in modern mathematics.
