Nearly every mathematical object — numbers, functions, spaces, structures — can be defined as a set. Set theory provides the shared vocabulary and the axiomatic foundation (typically ZFC) on which modern mathematics is built.

It also contains some of the most mind-bending results in all of math: different sizes of infinity, the axiom of choice, and the continuum hypothesis.
