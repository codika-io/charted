Nearly every mathematical object — numbers, functions, spaces, structures — can be defined as a set. Set theory provides the shared vocabulary and the axiomatic foundation on which modern mathematics is built. When a mathematician writes "let $x \in X$," they are speaking set theory, whether the context is algebra, analysis, or topology. Understanding sets is not one branch among many; it is the substrate from which the other branches grow.

Set theory also contains some of the most mind-bending results in all of math: different sizes of infinity, the axiom of choice and its bizarre consequences, and the continuum hypothesis — a question so fundamental that it turned out to be unanswerable within the standard axioms.

The story begins with **Georg Cantor**, who between the 1870s and 1890s single-handedly created the theory of infinite sets. Cantor showed that infinity comes in layers: the natural numbers, the real numbers, and an endless tower of ever-larger infinities beyond them. His **diagonal argument** proved that there are strictly more real numbers than natural numbers, even though both collections are infinite. This was a revolution. It was also controversial, and the paradoxes lurking in his informal approach would soon demand attention.

In 1901, **Bertrand Russell** delivered the sharpest blow. His paradox — does the set of all sets that do not contain themselves contain itself? — showed that naive set formation is inherently inconsistent. Mathematics needed a more careful foundation.

That foundation came from **Ernst Zermelo** and **Abraham Fraenkel**, who developed a system of axioms restricting which sets can be formed. Their framework, **ZFC** (Zermelo-Fraenkel with the axiom of Choice), became the standard foundation for mathematics by mid-century. Later, **Kurt Godel** and **Paul Cohen** proved that certain natural questions — including the continuum hypothesis — can be neither proved nor refuted from these axioms. Set theory is where the inherent blind spots of mathematics become visible.

This branch traces the full arc of that story across nine sub-topics, each building on the ones before it.

In Naive Set Theory, we begin where Cantor began: with the intuitive idea of a collection, basic operations like union and intersection, and the paradoxes that arise when this intuition is pushed too far.

Functions and Cardinality develops the tools for comparing set sizes. **Bijections** become the measuring stick, and we meet countability, uncountability, and the Schroder-Bernstein theorem.

The ZFC Axioms presents the formal response to the paradoxes — each axiom of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, what it permits and forbids, and the **cumulative hierarchy** that pictures the set-theoretic universe as a layered structure.

Ordinals and Cardinals extends the natural numbers into the transfinite. **Ordinal numbers** generalize "position in a sequence" to infinite well-ordered sets, while **cardinal numbers** generalize "size." Transfinite arithmetic is strange, and this sub-topic makes its distinctions precise.

The Axiom of Choice is the most controversial axiom in mathematics: given any collection of non-empty sets, one can choose an element from each — even without an explicit rule. We explore its equivalences (Zorn's lemma, the well-ordering theorem) and its counterintuitive consequences like the Banach-Tarski paradox.

The Continuum Hypothesis asks whether there is a set whose size falls strictly between the naturals and the reals. Cantor conjectured no. Godel showed in 1940 it cannot be disproved from ZFC; Cohen showed in 1963 it cannot be proved either.

Large Cardinals and Inner Models ventures into the upper reaches of infinity — **inaccessible**, **measurable**, and **supercompact** cardinals so large their existence cannot be proved in ZFC and must be assumed as new axioms.

Forcing and Independence presents **Cohen's method of forcing**, the technique for constructing new models of set theory and the central tool for proving independence results.

Finally, Combinatorial and Alternative Set Theory surveys the broader landscape: partition calculus and infinitary combinatorics, **descriptive set theory** and the structure of definable sets of reals, and alternative foundations like Quine's New Foundations (NF).

Set theory is where mathematics turns inward and examines its own foundations. The questions it raises — what is a number, what is infinity, what can be proved — shape the tools every mathematician uses and reveal the boundaries of what formal reasoning can achieve. This branch begins with the most accessible idea in mathematics (what is a collection?) and arrives at some of the deepest (what is the nature of mathematical truth?). That arc is what makes set theory extraordinary.
