Geometry is one of the oldest mathematical disciplines, born from the practical demands of surveying land and constructing buildings in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. But it was in Greece that geometry became something far more ambitious: a deductive science. When Euclid compiled his *Elements* around 300 BCE, he did not merely catalogue geometric facts — he organized everything into a logical structure built from five postulates, demonstrating that an entire universe of spatial truths could flow from a handful of stated assumptions. That achievement influenced every branch of mathematics for more than two thousand years, and the phrase "as rigorous as Euclid" remained the gold standard of careful reasoning well into the modern era.

The story took a dramatic turn in the early nineteenth century, when mathematicians began questioning Euclid's fifth postulate — the parallel postulate, which states that through a point outside a line there passes exactly one line parallel to it. For centuries, geometers had suspected this postulate was secretly redundant, that it could be derived from the first four. Then Carl Friedrich Gauss, Nikolai Lobachevsky, and János Bolyai independently discovered something astonishing: replacing the parallel postulate with a different assumption produces a geometry that is equally consistent. In hyperbolic geometry, infinitely many parallels pass through the given point; in the elliptic geometry of Bernhard Riemann, none do. These were not pathological curiosities — they were fully coherent geometric worlds, each with its own version of triangles, circles, and distance.

Riemann's 1854 habilitation lecture, "On the Hypotheses Which Lie at the Foundations of Geometry," reframed the entire subject. Instead of asking which geometry was *the* correct description of space, Riemann proposed studying all possible geometries at once, classifying them by how distance is measured at each point. His notion of a manifold — a space that looks locally like ordinary Euclidean space but may curve and twist globally — became the language of modern differential geometry. Gauss had already shown that the curvature of a surface is an intrinsic property, detectable by creatures living on the surface itself without reference to any surrounding space. Riemann elevated this insight to arbitrary dimensions, and the resulting framework eventually provided Albert Einstein with precisely the mathematical language he needed to formulate general relativity. The geometry of spacetime, it turned out, is Riemannian — our universe curves in response to mass and energy, and gravity is nothing other than that curvature.

David Hilbert, at the turn of the twentieth century, returned to the axiomatic foundations and finished what Euclid had started. His 1899 *Grundlagen der Geometrie* filled the logical gaps in Euclid's original treatment, providing a complete, rigorous axiom system that addressed the points, lines, and planes Euclid had left implicitly defined. Hilbert's work also initiated the broader program of axiomatizing all of mathematics, which would eventually lead to Gödel's incompleteness theorems and the modern study of mathematical logic. Felix Klein, meanwhile, offered a unifying vision through his Erlangen Program: every geometry could be characterized by a group of transformations that left its fundamental properties invariant. Euclidean geometry is the study of properties preserved under rigid motions; projective geometry studies what survives projection; topology studies what remains after arbitrary continuous deformations. This perspective dissolved old boundaries and turned the study of geometry into the study of symmetry.

The twentieth century brought a further revolution through algebraic geometry, a field that seeks to understand geometric objects defined by polynomial equations. The classical theory of curves and surfaces over the real or complex numbers, developed by figures such as Riemann and Max Noether, gave way to something far more general and abstract. Alexander Grothendieck, working in Paris in the 1950s and 1960s, rebuilt algebraic geometry from the ground up, replacing varieties with schemes and introducing sheaves, cohomology, and topos theory as the natural tools of the subject. His work was so powerful and so general that it eventually touched number theory, representation theory, and mathematical physics in equal measure, reshaping what mathematicians meant by the word "space" itself.

The three sub-topics in this branch trace the arc of that long story. Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry begins with Euclid's axiomatic method and the classical results of plane geometry, then examines what happens when the parallel postulate is abandoned, leading to hyperbolic and elliptic geometries, projective geometry, and Klein's unifying Erlangen Program. Differential Geometry picks up where Riemann left off, building the theory of smooth manifolds, connections, and curvature that underlies both modern mathematical physics and the deepest results about the shape of surfaces and higher-dimensional spaces — including the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, Riemannian metrics, fiber bundles, and the index theory connecting analysis to topology. Algebraic Geometry then moves into the most abstract terrain, starting from the relationship between polynomial equations and geometric shapes, passing through Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and the theory of projective varieties and sheaves, and arriving at schemes, moduli spaces, derived categories, and the frontiers of motivic geometry.

Together, these three perspectives — axiomatic, differential, and algebraic — reveal geometry not as a single subject but as a vast family of related disciplines, all asking the same fundamental question from different angles: what is the structure of space, and how can we measure, classify, and transform it? That question has driven mathematics for three millennia, and it shows no sign of exhausting itself.
