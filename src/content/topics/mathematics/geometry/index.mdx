Geometry is among the oldest branches of mathematics, rooted in the practical need to measure land. Euclid's *Elements* organized it into an axiomatic system that stood for two millennia — until the 19th century discovery that his parallel postulate could be replaced, yielding entirely new, consistent geometries.

That discovery eventually led to Einstein's general relativity: the geometry of our universe is not Euclidean.
